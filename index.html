         THE SPECS

        Each Bored Ape is unique and programmatically generated from over 170 <br>

         are dope, but some are rarer than others.

     <p class="blue">
        The apes are stored as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and <br>
         hosted on IPFS. <ins class="power">(See Record and Proof.)</ins> Purchasing an ape costs 0.08 ETH.

        To access members-only areas such as <ins class="power">THE BATHROOM </ins>, Apeholders will <br>

        WELCOME TO THE CLUB
    </h2>
    <p>
        When you buy a Bored Ape, you’re not simply buying an avatar or a provably-rare piece of art. You are gaining <br>
         membership access to a club whose benefits and offerings will increase over time. Your Bored Ape can serve as your
         <br> digital identity, and open digital doors for you.

        THE BATHROOM

         contains a canvas accessible only to wallets containing at least one ape. Like <br>
          any good dive bar bathroom, this is the place to draw, scrawl, or write <br>
           expletives.</p>
           <p class="para">
            Each ape-holder will be able to paint a pixel on the bathroom wall every fifteen <br>

             members-only canvas for the discerning minds of crypto twitter.
